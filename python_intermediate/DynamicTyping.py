# Dynamic Typing
# Dynamic Typing vs. Static Type vs Strong typing

# Dynamic typing means that runtime objects (values) have a type,
# as opposed to static typing where variables have a type

# Strong typing means that varialbes do have a type and 
# that the type matters when performing operations on a variable.
